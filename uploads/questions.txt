1. TASK 1A: What does the overflow property do? What happens when
    you set it to auto vs. hidden? 

    This property decides how the content is displayed if the content
    overflows its container. If it is set to auto, there will be a scroll
    bar to look though the contents of the box. If it is set to hidden,
    the content will be "cut off" to the size of the box.


2. TASK 1B: What does the order property do for a flex-item?
    The "order" property puts the elements of the box
    in order depending on their number.

4. Write a description of what happens in the push function.

    The push function pushes the most recent button press onto
    the actions array then creates a new div element to prepend
    onto the containerElement (which is either the redoStackContainer
    or the undoStackContainer).


5. Write a description of what happens in the pop function.

    The pop function gets the first child of containerElement (a.k.a.
    the most recent number button press), deletes the div element, then
    pops and returns the last entry in the action array.


6. What does the defer attribute do? Where would we have to put these
    two statements if we didn't have defer?

    'defer' means that the scripts load stack.js and index.js once the document
    has finished loading. If we didn't haev defer, we would have to put these statements
    at the end of the html document.
